# Tools for Data

We've collected some basic tools for working with Data at Sea

## Internal Tools

A small set of tools are being developed here and are kept in the tools/ directory on the GitHub Repository. Each tools is developed in a notebook style environment. We typically work with Python based tools but also can produce R and MATLAB/Octave notebooks. For more information see How to Use Notebooks.

### Pre-Cruise Planning

- **[wgetBathymetry]({% link docs/tools/wgetBathymetry.md %})** - Download bathymetry data for your cruise area

## Code Snippets

Useful code snippets that do not warrant a whole notebook.

```bash
here is a code snippet
```

## External Tools

External tools are maintained outside of this working group, please reference their documentation for use.
